# Tic-Tac-Toe
It is a tic-tac-toe game, in which two players alternatively select their position to place their respective symbols(X, O) allocated to them.
In this code, I used the 'X' symbol for Player 1 and the 'O' symbol for Player 2.
The first player who places three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game!
